# DNDCharacterCreationWebsite
This website randomizes a Dungeons and Dragons character that you can save with a username and password and access again at any time. Logs all information to a database. I created this for my internship to learn PHP and HTML.
Languages used: primarily PHP, HTML, and mySQL with some JSON, JavaScript, and CSS. Currently converting project to MVC model.
